# CSGO-Ping-Tester
A tool that allows you to check your ping on different regions for Matchmaking, FaceIT, and ESEA servers with only 1-click.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/

How do I download this amazing tool? Check out this awesome video ---> (・ω・)
