# Current Project Status:

Written in Python with Tkinter as GUI Library. Standard GPL 3.0 Licence carried over.

I've managed to also tweak a few things so this entire program should run natively on MacOS, Linux, Unix and Windows.

Please see "Releases" for latest builds + releases.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/
