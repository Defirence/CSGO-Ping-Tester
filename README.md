Coded in Python3.6 with Tkinter as GUI Library. Standard GPL 3.0 Licence carried over.

.py script should work fine if you have Python 3.6 installed on Mac/Linux, Windows it should run as a standalone .exe but if it doesn't work just download and install Python 3.6.

Please see "Releases" for latest builds + releases.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/
