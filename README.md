# Current Project Status:

Development on this project has resumed! I've fixed the cross-platform issue by using WINE on my MacOS laptop, I'm busy cleaning up code and refactoring, optimizing and so forth.

Written in Python 3.7 with Tkinter as GUI Library. Standard GPL 3.0 Licence carried over.

I've managed to also tweak a few things so this entire program should run natively on MacOS, Linux, Unix and Windows. Just have to try and set up the correct VM's to compile with for Windows, MacOS, Unix and so forth.

Please see "Releases" for latest builds + releases.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/

# Testing

Currently working with Windows 7, MacOS, other ENV's to be tested.

# DIY / Compile it yourself

Use pyinstaller with the argument (and resources from the build folder):

pyinstaller guimain.py
