# Current Project Status:

Attempting a MacOS version but unfortunately too busy with work, so this project is dormant for now until I have spare time to work on it. If you want to, please fork and update as necessary.

Coded in Python3.6 with Tkinter as GUI Library. Standard GPL 3.0 Licence carried over.

.py script should work fine if you have Python 3.6 installed on Mac/Linux, Windows it should run as a standalone .exe but if it doesn't work just download and install Python 3.6.

Please see "Releases" for latest builds + releases.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/

# Testing

Tested on Windows 7 x64, unfortunately my PC is not good enough to run VM's and test on older versions of Windows, and including Mac OS X + Linux. If someone out there is nice enough to possibly allow me access to VM's or VPS's to test please contact me at
