A tool that allows you to check your ping on different regions for Matchmaking, FaceIT, and ESEA servers with only 1-click.

I accidentally merged the wrong pull request on 30-04-2020 and lost all my old commits. This is why everything is so new again. :(

From 03-05-2020 I have added a GPG key which will be used to sign all commits from hereon, please ignore the unverified commits. Those were just to test my GPG key setup and get it to work correctly.

# Current Project Status:

Current Development Status: Halted/Partial-Maintenance

I currently don't have spare time to maintain the servers and code for this project as I'm working full time. If you would like to maintain or fork this project, go ahead, but PLEASE use the original licence from the original author in your fork/clone to avoid any legal issues. I'm changing some things here and there as I get the time to but with the current state of the world and also my personal life I unfortunately don't have a lot of time to maintain the code for this.

As soon as I have time and environments to compile new builds for different OS'ses (Linux and MacOS) I'll commit and release as soon as possible.

Written in Python 3.8.1 with Tkinter as GUI Library. Standard GPL 3.0 Licence carried over.

Please see "Releases" for latest builds + releases.

Uses updated information from here: https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/master/Random/NetworkDatagramConfig.json

Unfortunately, for the moment I cannot add South African ESEA servers due to there being limited information on the IP's they use, for the meantime there is an ESEA status tracker here: https://status.esea.net/
